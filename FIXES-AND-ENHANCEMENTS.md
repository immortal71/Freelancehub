## üìù Notes

1. **LocalStorage Usage**: Currently using localStorage for demo purposes. Replace with actual API calls.

2. **File Uploads**: Profile picture and file uploads create hidden file inputs. Backend should handle multipart/form-data.

3. **Notifications**: Toast notifications are client-side. Backend should push real-time notifications.

4. **Data Export**: Currently generates demo JSON. Backend should compile real user data.

5. **Security**: Password change and account deletion need backend validation and authentication.

6. **Responsive Design**: All features tested and working on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

7. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and ARIA labels implemented.

## üéâ Conclusion

The Client Portal is now fully functional with all interactive elements working correctly. All buttons, modals, forms, and features are ready for user interaction. The next step is backend API integration to persist data and add real authentication.
